# üìÅ ReadWriteCompleteCode

A simple yet complete Node.js project that demonstrates how to read from and write to files using core modules like `fs`. This project is ideal for beginners looking to understand file handling in Node.js in a clean, modular, and well-commented format.

## üöÄ Features

- üîÑ **Read data from a file** using `fs.readFile` and `fs.readFileSync`
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Write data to a file** using `fs.writeFile` and `fs.writeFileSync`
- ‚ûï Appends and overwrites content
- ‚úÖ Error handling for common file I/O issues
- üì¶ Minimal setup and dependencies

## üìå Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
- A text/code editor (e.g., VS Code)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CKofficial-1797/ReadWriteCompleteCode.git
   cd ReadWriteCompleteCode
   ```

2. **Run the program**:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

   This will read data from `files/input.txt`, process it (if applicable), and write the output to `files/output.txt`.

---

## üìò Usage

- Modify the contents of `input.txt` with the text you want to read.
- The program reads the file, optionally processes it (e.g., converts to uppercase), and writes the result to `output.txt`.

Example:

```txt
// input.txt
Hello, this is a test.

// output.txt (after write)
HELLO, THIS IS A TEST.
```

## üìö Concepts Demonstrated

- `fs.readFile` and `fs.readFileSync`
- `fs.writeFile` and `fs.writeFileSync`
- Basic file error handling
- Synchronous vs Asynchronous operations in Node.js

## üß† Why This Project?

This mini-project was built to demonstrate real-world usage of Node.js file handling methods and serves as a great template or boilerplate for beginners to start understanding backend fundamentals.
